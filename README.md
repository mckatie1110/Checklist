Block Scroll
============
Block scroll is a jQuery plugin that turns a set of <div> elements into a blocks and displays them one screen at a time. The idea is to break up your page into chunks for better presentation and user-flow. Block Scroll automatically turns your page responsive.

Features
--------
Up and down movements can be performed using keyboard, scroll, buttons, or the mouse wheel*.

As well, the design is responsive and it automatically adjusts to any reasonable resolution so long as you don't overload each block.

Pages are sticky, which means that they automatically adjust to the vertical center of the screen.

The look and feel are customizable through css and initialization settings.

Up and down buttons are automatically wired in so long as you use the right id names for them.

You can change the location of the active block using javascript after it's initialized.
