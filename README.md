Web Design Checklist
--------------------

I began working on this project during week seven of my classes at The Iron Yard.  This checklist is an ongoing project that will eventually include rules and reminders for web design.  Each element of web design is divided into sections so it is organized and easy to understand. The sections include HTMl, CSS, SCSS, Typography, Color and many more!
